Biological motivation of fuzzy categorical variables
In computational modeling of neural activity, the firing rate of a neuronal axon varies from nearly no activity to a maximum tonic rate. This can be represented as a fuzzy categorical variable. If a neuron is connected to, say, a pain receptor, then a zero would represent no pain signal, and a one, the highest amount of pain the receptor can sense.
