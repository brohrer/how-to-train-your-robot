\subsection{Versions}
\label{subsec:versions}

The \textbf{\href{
https://codeberg.org/brohrer/how-to-train-your-robot/raw/branch/main/chapter_9/ziptie.pdf}
{latest version}}
of this document and all the files needed to
render it are in \textbf{\href{
https://codeberg.org/brohrer/how-to-train-your-robot/src/branch/main/chapter_9}
{this Codeberg repository}}. There's a backup copy in \textbf{
\href{https://github.com/brohrer/how-to-train-your-robot/tree/main/chapter_9}
{this repository on GitHub}}.

I don't expect this doc to ever be done. I'm always learning new things,
or thinking of a better way to explain something, or I do a new
piece of work I can't help myself from including. And there's always
one more bug.
Since it's a git repository, you are free to browse past commits to watch
the evolution, but I'll try to keep a running record of important updates
here.

and how it's related to the rest of the algorithmic world.}

\subsection{History}
\label{subsec:history}

Ziptie didn't start life in its current form. It actually has a long
and very boring history.

\begin{itemize}

\item{\textbf{2011}. As the method was taking shape, I published a 
flurry of posters and write-ups in small conferences

\item{\textbf{2012-01-14}.
The oldest version of the code I can find.
At this point Ziptie was called Grouper
and was written in MATLAB. A lot of details have changed since this point,
but the acculumulation of coactivation as a clustering mechanism has not.
\href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattchapmansoftwareengineer/}{Matt Chapman}
was an early collaborator and helped me transition the code from the private
research repo I'd been developing in to something more public.

If you end up using Ziptie in your work, give it a shout out.
Here's an APA example you can copy and paste. (You may have to fiddle with
the dates.)

If you're so inclined, drop me a note too (brohrer@gmail.com).
I love to hear about how
Ziptie is being used. It gives me ideas for how to make it better.
